      Mumtaz Mahal (1 September 1593 – 17 June 1631) [mumˈt̪aːz mɛˈɦɛl]; meaning "the chosen one of the palace") was a Mughal Empress and chief consort of emperor Shah Jahan. The Taj Mahal in Agra was constructed by her husband as her final resting place.

She was born as Arjumand Banu Begum in Agra into a family of Persian nobility as a daughter of Abdul Hasan Asaf Khan, making her a niece and later, a stepdaughter-in-law of Empress Nur Jehan, the wife of the emperor Jahangir.[1] Arjumand Banu Begum was married at the age of 19, on 10 May 1613, to Prince Khurram, later known as Emperor.

     who conferred upon her the title "Mumtaz Mahal". Although betrothed to Shah Jahan in 1607, she ultimately became his 4th wife in 1612 and was one of his favourites. She died in Burhanpur in the Deccan (now in Madhya Pradesh) during the birth of their fourteenth child, a daughter named Gauhara Begum.[2]

Mumtaz Mahal mothered fourteen children by Shah Jahan, including Aurangzeb; the Imperial Prince Dara Shikoh, the heir apparent anointed by Shah Jahan, who temporarily succeeded Shah Jahan until deposed by his brother Aurangzeb; and Jahanara Begum, the Imperial Princess.
